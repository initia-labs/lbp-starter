# LBP Frontend Starter

A minimal frontend starter template designed for LBP (Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool) projects. It includes basic components for displaying token charts, wallet connection, and swap transaction examples.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Token price chart visualization
- Wallet connect integration
- Swap transaction example
- Easily customizable for your own token and backend

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

### Clone and Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/lbp-starter
cd lbp-starter/frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## ðŸ”§ Customization

You need to modify the following files to suit your project. Currently, they are configured based on a specific testnet token for demonstration purposes.

### [`src/data/constants.ts`](src/data/constants.ts)

- `restUrl`: Change this to `"https://rest.initia.xyz"` when using the mainnet.
- `pair`, `coinA`, `coinB`: Replace these with the addresses generated by your backend process. You can find the required metadata using this endpoint: [https://rest.testnet.initia.xyz/initia/move/v1/metadata?denom=uinit](https://rest.testnet.initia.xyz/initia/move/v1/metadata?denom=uinit)
- `baseCoin`, `quoteCoin`: If `coinA` is the base token and `coinB` is the quote token for your project, leave them as they are. If it's the opposite, switch them accordingly.

### [`src/data/api.ts`](src/data/api.ts)

- `fetchPrices()`: Replace the mock API with the actual endpoint provided by your backend process. The current setup uses mock data to demonstrate functionality in an isolated environment. (After replacing it, you can delete [`src/data/example.json`](src/data/example.json).)

### [`src/main.tsx`](src/main.tsx)

- `<WalletWidgetProvider />`: If your project is going to be deployed on mainnet, remove all props assigned to this component.

### Styling/Design

This project comes with **no UI styling**, so feel free to build your own design system or integrate your preferred UI framework.
